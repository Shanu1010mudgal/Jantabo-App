## How to Play

Your "ship" is drawn at the bottom of the screen. You can press and hold the left and right sides of the screen to move left and right, respectively. Avoid the incoming asteroids. Double-tap to fire the current weapon. This launches a projectile that can destroy asteroids. Destroying asteroids gets you points. After destroying a certain amount of asteroids, you get a reward - more ammunition or a new weapon.

As you destroy more asteroids, the game speeds up and it becomes harder to evade them. Also, you have an ammunition counter at the bottom of the screen that decreases as you fire more projectiles. If you are hit by an asteroid or you run out of ammunition, you lose the game. The objective is to hit as many asteroids as you can, and get as many points as possible, without losing.
